This model and accompanying score optimization were completed by
the team, not only by me, Roderick Landreth. I was repsonsible mainly for
dimension designing, and modeling lift/control surfaces and main subsystem
connecting structures. The CG calc was found on an RC plane forum, though
agrees with hand calculations. Developement and testing this model and 
physical craft, and a technical design report and presentation
counted as my Union College Aero Advanced 2020 Senior Project.
